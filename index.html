				<p id="heroText">Whatever it is you are currently working on.</p>
				<p>Your idea. Your project. Your startup. Your dream.</p>
				<p>Go for it! Innovate! Build it! But build it  <em>open</em>…<br></p>

				<p>Because this world is a hell of a lot more fun if everyone gets to enjoy it.</p>
				<p>The trillions who might follow you should do so too.</p>

				<p>Don't go for walled gardens. Instead, create open ecosystems that invite others to contribute.</p>

				<p>They will bring their domain knowledge.</p>
				<p>They might base their businesses on you.</p>
				<p>They will take it to levels you could never have imagined.</p>

				<p>Let others steal your ideas. It’s a signal you’re doing something valuable.</p>
				<p>Help others learn what you do best. So you can jump on to the next challenge.</p>

				<p>Tell others where you messed up. So they don’t have to make the same mistakes.</p>
				<p>Make money where you are irreplaceable. And you will remain irreplaceable.</p>

				<p>Save the time and paper you need for NDAs.</p>
				<p>Make kids and paper planes instead.</p>

				<p>Ditch your club nights for hackathons. But don’t forget to party.</p>
				<p>Start dancing on your desk and celebrate every time someone else creates something cool -</p>
				<p>by using your code, your artwork, your design, your sounds, your thoughts, and your ideas.</p>

				<p>Talk to the guys with the ties - and to the offbeats with the funny hats.</p>
				<p>Discuss your ideas with your colleagues, your friends, and your enemies.</p>

				<p>Quarrel with your boss and challenge your grandma, knowing elder people are wise.</p>
				<p>And sometimes the good ol' things can be upcycled to rock the world.</p>

				<p>Break down the barriers between tradition and innovation.</p>

				<p>Invite your suppliers, intensify your partnerships, involve your customers, and understand those who do not go for you yet.</p>

				<p>Find the best from all industries and combine it into a new benchmark, artwork, piece of art, work of art, or monument.</p>

				<p>Mix up your communities because this world is motley and wild.</p>
				<p>Untie your company and unleash your fantasy.</p>

				<p>Don’t be afraid to lose power, control, or market share.</p>
				<p>As long as you remember to keep your doors and your minds open - and get ready to receive.</p>

				<p>The more knowledge, the more ideas, the more experiences you give away, the more you will eventually get back.</p>
				<p>Go for a smooth balance between give and take.</p>

				<p>Share your love and passion for building exciting new things.</p>
				<p>Don't let budgets, processes or bureaucracy wreck your intentions.</p>
				<p>Build on diversity, openness, and collaboration instead.</p>

				<p>Go for real challenges and rock your open space, your jam, your meetup.</p>

				<p>Place the awards on your shelves, your accomplishments will make you smile.</p>
				<p>It’s putting a dent in the universe that will make it all worth the effort.</p>
				<p>Of being open …<em>first</em>.</p>
